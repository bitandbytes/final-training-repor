The initial idea for a third university for Singapore was mooted in 1997 by the Singapore government. Then Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Tony Tan highly believed that the new university should be of a different model than the currently established British model universities like National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU). With the ideology of Prof. Tan Chin Tiong Singapore Management University came out to be an American-style university with a broad-based education. Singapore Management University adapted the model of Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania as a role model. Then the Wharton-SMU agreement was signed in 1999 giving birth to the Wharton-SMU Research Centre. Then Deputy Dean of the Wharton School commenced as the first president of the Singapore Management University.
